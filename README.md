# personal-autosetup-fedora
## Disclaimer
As "personal" in the project name suggests, this repository is originally designed for my personal use only.
However this projects could very well be used as a template for anyone else.
The script is meant to be run on a fresh install of the latest Fedora KDE spin but may very well also work on other Fedora systems and could even be adapter for other distributions.

## The project
This repository contains an ansible script to automatically set up my desired linux environment.
It handels packages, flatpacks, configuration files and many other things while still trying to be easy to use.
I use it to keep the configuration of all my systems in sync.
